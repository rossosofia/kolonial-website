            Nørrebro Kolonial is a local store located in Nørrebro. We sell
            quality products made by small producers with a craft from Greece,
            France and Italy. <br />
            <br />
            We sell the experience of the countries by the smell, taste and
            appereance of the store.

          <h1>Who we are</h1>
          <p>
            At Nørrebro Kolonial we aim to be a direct link between small
            international farms and consumers.
            <br />
            <br />
            We want to be able to have the knowledge about every product that we
            have in the store: how it is produced, where it comes from, what is
            the story behind every product and we want to have a certain quality
            that we believe is the quality we choose for our store.
            <br />
            <br />
            We spend a lot of time choosing what we have, and it is about small
            producers with a craft.
